# MachineLearning_Practices

The implementations about the Machine Learning and Neural Network algorithm by Python.<br>Now these are all incomplete.
## The plan ( temporarily
* Classification
	* k-Nearest Neighbor ( KNN
	* Naive Bayesian Model
	* AdaBoost
	* Support Vector Machine ( SVM
* Regression
	* Logistic
	* Support Vector Machine ( SVM
	* CART
* Unsupervised-Learning
	* Apriori
		* item set mining and association rule learning
	* FP-growth
		* item set mining
